# geth_tools
Tools to avoid having to work in the Geth console directly

# Install
Currently we support OS X and Linux!

## Prerequisite
1. Geth (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth)
2. DaggerC (https://github.com/Sword-Smith/Daggerc)
-- Alternatively run install_on_linux

To set up geth_tools

1. Clone repo
2. Run "initialize_genesis_block.pl"
3. Run "run_geth.pl"

Now a fully configured geth instance should be running.

Solidity and Dagger contracts can now be deployed by running compile_and_deploy.pl
